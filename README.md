# Stock Market Data Analysis with Kafka

## Overview

This project aims to demonstrate an end-to-end data engineering solution for analyzing real-time stock market data using various technologies including Python, Amazon Web Services (AWS), Apache Kafka, Glue, Athena, and SQL.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Amazon Web Services (AWS)**:
  - **S3 (Simple Storage Service)**: For storing raw and processed data.
  - **Athena**: For querying data stored in S3 using SQL.
  - **Glue Crawler**: For automatically discovering schema from raw data in S3.
  - **Glue Catalog**: For storing metadata and schema information.
  - **EC2**: For hosting Kafka brokers.
- **Apache Kafka**: For building real-time data pipelines.

## Dataset

You can use any dataset containing real-time stock market data for this project. The focus of this project is on the operational aspects of data engineering, including building data pipelines, rather than on the specific dataset used.

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

- **data/**: Contains sample datasets (not included in this repository).
- **src/**: Contains Python scripts for data processing and Kafka producer/consumer implementations.
- **scripts/**: Contains setup and utility scripts.
- **notebooks/**: Contains Jupyter notebooks for data exploration and analysis.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Set up the required AWS services (S3, Athena, Glue) and Apache Kafka on EC2 instances.
3. Prepare your dataset or use a sample dataset and store it in the `data/` directory.
4. Update the configuration files and scripts as needed.
5. Run the necessary scripts and notebooks to start the data pipeline and analyze the data.
